The user inputs responses to a spotify prompt, asking if they'd like to add songs to a playlist, create a playlist, upload songs and the like. Then the code outputs the songs and playlist for the user to review.
All you need to run the code is enter it in and run from the spotify file. 
User must answer Y/N for yes or no quesitions, code will not run properly if user enters it differently. If the demo songs is missing from directory, the code will not work properly as well. Those are the main issues that will break the code, if any others are found, please contact me at jpt37@pitt.edu. The main conscepts tested in this assignment are inheritance, file reading and writing from code.
